# Logitech Remote Key Mapper (LRKM) 

The Logitech Remote Key Mapper is a Python script designed to enhance the functionality of Logitech presentation remotes by providing a customizable button mapping solution for different Linux distros. The official Logitech App is not available in Linux-based distros. 

This solution allows users to map each button on the Logitech remote to a different keyboard or mouse button, enabling a more personalized and efficient control experience during presentations or other use cases - For example, presenting the content of a Web Page where the Left button in the Logitech remote needs to be remapped to mouse scroll up or down.

Feel free to fork the repo, happy codding!
